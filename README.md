The goal of this project is to analyse and visualise the Google Playstore dataset from Kaggle using Python (Matplotlib, seaborn and plotly).

The project involves the following steps:
1. Download the google-playstore dataset from kaggle and convert it into a pandas dataframe
2. Perform data cleaning/deal with missing values using Pandas and NumPy.
3. Plot interactive graphs to understand the data using visual libraries like Plotly.
4. Ask and Answer interesting questions from the dataset.
